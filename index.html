											<h2>Statement From the Steering Committee Regarding the
Indivisible Denver Facebook Group</h2>
								    </header>

										 <p> Message to the Indivisible Denver community:<br>
  <br>
  This statement is being delivered on behalf of the Indivisible Denver steering committee. The ID steering committee consists of representatives from each of the currently existing ID committees, as well as members who have been working in an overarching organizational capacity, and who have been working on a volunteer basis to organize this group for effective action. No member of the steering committee is paid by the Democratic or any other political party. One of our central goals has been to develop an open, democratic process that can best represent the interests and voices of the broader ID membership.<br>
  <br>
  Questions have emerged about the management of the original Indivisible Denver Facebook group, and about the relationship between the steering committee and that group. The recent decision to make the Facebook group public and to close the group to comments was made by a single individual who does not have the consensus of the steering committee. We have attempted to address with this individual any concerns he may have about the use of this group, and have come to the conclusion that this individual and the steering committee have incompatible views as to the mission and direction of Indivisible Denver. <br>
  <br>
  It is the consensus view of the steering committee that because this individual has sole control over this Facebook group, we have no choice but to separate our activities from this group. Going forward the activities of the Indivisible Denver steering committee, including today&rsquo;s meeting, will be communicated via our new independent webpage, <a dir="ltr" target="_blank" href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Findivisibledenver.org%2F&h=ATO6WM8iJ0z3LV68slC5cU8ikxd4oGVuLAoh55DirVnDiOlg9FWarDrB5Se-3I-twhgBjmKWkSmG8ufl8VOxtIBEOh9uLBnjXnItxKF_e5khmOIYz3Jct00VFb1fAUKhNRFl4uR54EEJ70kzx9FT" rel="nofollow noopener">indivisibledenver.org</a>, as well as this new Facebook group. We invite any members who are concerned about the direction of the original Facebook group to join us on this new group, where we will continue our efforts to fight the Trump agenda. We value openness and transparency in our process, and will be happy to answer additional questions on this new group as well.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you, and we sincerely apologize for any confusion this has caused. We are eager to move beyond this situation and to refocus our energy on political action and civic engagement consistent with goals of the larger Indivisible movement.<br>
  <br>
  Sincerely,<br>
  <br>
  Members of the Indivisible Denver CD1 Steering Committee</p>
